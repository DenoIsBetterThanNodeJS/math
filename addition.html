    <h1>Addition</h1>
    <p>
        Addition is one of the basic operations in mathematics.
    It involves combining two or more numbers to get a total or sum.
    For example, if you have 3 apples and you get 2 more, you
    can add them together to find out that you now have 5 apples.
    The symbol for addition is the plus sign (+).
    Addition is used in everyday life, such as when you are 
    counting money, measuring ingredients for a recipe, or
    keeping track of scores in a game. It's a fundamental skill
    that helps us understand and solve many different types of problems.
