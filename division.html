    <h1>Division</h1>
    <p>     Division is a mathematical operation that involves splitting a number into equal parts.
        For example, if you have 12 apples and you want to divide them equally among 4 friends, you divide
        12 by 4 to find out that each friend gets 3 apples. The symbol for division is the slash (/)
        or sometimes the division sign (÷). Division is used in everyday life, such as when you are sharing
        items equally, calculating the average, or determining how many times one number fits into another. 
        It’s an important skill for understanding and solving problems involving equal 
        distribution and partitioning.
