    <h1> Multiplication</h1>
    <p>     Multiplication is a mathematical operation that involves combining equal groups to find the 
        total number of items. For example, if you have 4 groups of 3 apples each, you multiply
        4 by 3 to find out that you have 12 apples in total. The symbol for multiplication is the
        asterisk (*) or sometimes a dot (·). Multiplication is used in many real-life
        situations, such as when you are calculating the total cost of multiple 
        items, determining the area of a rectangle,
        or figuring out how many items are in several groups.
        It’s a powerful tool for understanding and solving problems involving repeated addition.</p>
