    <h1>Operators</h1>
    <p>In math, an operator is a symbol that tells us what kind of math operation to perform. The four basic operators are:
    </p><p>
        <a href="addition.html">Addition</a> (+): This operator tells us to add two numbers together. For example, (3 + 2 = 5).
    </p><p>
    <a href="subtraction.html">Subtraction</a> (-): This operator tells us to subtract one number from another. For example, (5 - 2 = 3).
    </p><p>    
    <a href="division.html">Division</a> (÷): This operator tells us to divide one number by another. For example, (8 ÷ 2 = 4).
    </p><p>
       <a href="multiplication.html">Multiplication</a> (×): This operator tells us to multiply two numbers. For example, (4 × 3 = 12).
    </p><p>
        These operators help us solve math problems by showing us what to do with the numbers.</p>
