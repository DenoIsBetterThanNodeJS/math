    <h1>Subtraction</h1>
    <p>     Subtraction is another basic operation in mathematics. It involves taking one number
        away from another to find the difference. For example, if you have 5 apples and you give away 2,
        you subtract 2 from 5 to find out that you have 3 apples left. The symbol for subtraction
        is the minus sign (-). Subtraction is used in everyday situations, such as when you are calculating change,
        measuring how much time has passed, or figuring out how many items are left after some have been taken away. 
        Itâ€™s an essential skill for solving problems and understanding how quantities change.</p>
